# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Aim
To evaluate the performance of supervised machine learning models to make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
## Overview
Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, we will oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and under sample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Used a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm to compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk.
